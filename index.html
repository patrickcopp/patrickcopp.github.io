      <h5>January 6th, 2020</h5>
      <p>My name is Patrick Copp. I am currently in my third year of study at the University of Guelph in the Computer Science Program. I am currently pursuing a minor degree in Business Economics. This blog is for the storage and display of my co-op work term reports throughout my years of study.</p>

        <h2>ERIS</h2>
        <h5>January 6th, 2020</h5>
        <p>My first co-op term of University started in May of 2019. I had 8 months of co-op, which I could either split into two separate four month co-op terms or have a single eight month co-op term. While applying for jobs for the Summer and Fall of 2019, both in and outside of the Guelph co-op portal, I made it clear that I was available for eight months to give me any sort of edge on the competition of desperate summer interns.

            I had a few interviews while applying, but no offers, until I applied for a position as a Data Technician at ERIS (Environmental Risk Information Services). I went to their Toronto office for an interview, where I was quizzed on Python, SQL, and basic communications questions, followed by a sit-down with a data engineer and the Director of Research and Data at ERIS. The director’s name was Melanie Veltman, she would eventually become my direct supervisor. I was informed that my job would mostly include working with Python and SQL to solve my colleagues’ problems and helping them with their work. I was offered the job a few days later on April 25th, with a starting day of May 6th, leaving me only eleven days to move to Toronto to start working. I found an apartment in those following days and moved in.
            <br/>
            ERIS’s main service is providing environmental risk information for developers within a set of national standards. The data team, of which I was a part, operates using an Oracle PL/SQL database to store environmental risk data across North America. The office that I worked in was located on 38 Lesmill Road in Toronto. There were fifteen people working with me on the data team, they worked all day with SQL procedures to ETL (Extract, Transfer, and Load) data from Government agencies into ERIS’s database.
