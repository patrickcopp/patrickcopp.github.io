      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <h5>January 6th, 2020</h5>
      <p>My name is Patrick Copp. I am completing my fourth year of study at the University of Guelph in the Computer Science Program. I am currently pursuing a minor degree in Business Economics. This blog is for the storage and display of my co-op work term reports throughout my years of study.</p>

      <h2>MANTECH</h2>
      <h5>September 14th, 2020</h5>
      <p>
        Note: The software I worked on during my co-op term is protected by an NDA and posting it publicly about its existence or what it even is, could be extremely damaging to MANTECH and therefore is not addressed.
          </br></br></br></br>
          My third co-op term was to take place from May of 2020 until August of 2020. I started applying to potential jobs in the winter of 2020: jobs in Canada, outside, all over. I had a number of interviews until I finally landed a job offer. The role was as a Junior Programmer at a software development firm called JOMAR Softcorp. I was pleased with my offer and especially happy I did not have to continue looking for a job for the summer.
          </br></br>Something else happened in the winter of 2020; the COVID-19 pandemic started. The pandemic jeopardized employment across the world, Canada itself had an unemployment rate of 13.7% and most companies had put in place hiring freezes. This effect was not lost upon co-op students: I had heard numerous reports among friends and classmates about growing numbers off rescinded offers and dwindling numbers of employers putting postings out for co-op students.
          </br></br>I had not personally heard back from JOMAR in quite a while and so I reached out to them again and heard back as of March 19. Supposedly, due to security concerns, they would not permit co-op students to work from home, and due to health concerns would also not permit any employees to work in the office. And so, one month before my co-op term was to begin, I was unemployed.
          </br></br>My unemployment wasn’t the end of the world. Trudeau announced CERB and CESB, a program for workers and students affected by the pandemic to supply a basic income. My initial plan after losing my job was to collect CERB (I qualified because of the income from my co-op positions in 2019) while gaining experience working for my father’s company, Primodal, on their proprietary software.
          </br></br> I did follow my initial plan for a while. My school had concluded early because of the pandemic, and as such I had no exams, and very little work so I began working for my father in early April. During this time I was still applying for work positions, but I had given up hope of anything I might deem worthwhile and so was throwing out applications with no emotional connection to any of them, convinced it was a hopeless pursuit.
          </br></br>As it happened, I did hear back from one of these postings I had applied to. It happened to be a research position for data mining with the University of Guelph. The job itself was ironically to study the COVID outbreak and its eventual results based upon any given country or region’s response: masks, containment, quarantine procedures, etc. The position was interesting to me, and I was continuing along with the application process, applying for grants, funding, when I heard from a close friend and roommate about another prospective job: as a Software Developer for a company called MANTECH Inc.
          </br></br>I heard from my roommate that his friend, whom I had met several times, was working for MANTECH as a Software Developer. They were producing a new piece of software and had asked Sean, my roommate’s friend, if he had any friends still looking for jobs amid the pandemic. Sean forwarded the idea to my friend, who sent it to me, knowing I was still looking for a job. I sent my resume in through Sean, gave him my email, and forgot about it, assuming I would never hear back. 
          </br></br>I did hear back. In late April I heard back about an interview with MANTECH for a potential work-from-home software development position. I learned that the technologies they were mainly working in were C# and Winforms- luckily, I had been using C# daily while working for my father. This experience proved to be invaluable in the interview: the interviewers seemed pleased with my answers to their questions, and told me they would soon get back to me.
        
          </br></br>I heard back from MANTECH a short while later, with a job offer. As I was still going through the application process with the University, I requested I be removed from their consideration as I had found a different opportunity. 
          </br></br>Working from home for MANTECH presented an interesting set of difficulties. Troubleshooting was made infinitely more difficult, I was working from my own computer which had to have all the relevant software downloaded, we had problems setting up git, GitScrum, and other requirements for developing their software. There were other, more personal difficulties, like being isolated from my coworkers, and missing out on making good connections with them. The difficulties were awkward for me to deal with: I and many others had obviously never dealt with this before COVID, and as the world shifts to a more working-from-home world, I believe those kinds of difficulties will become more prevalent.
          </br></br>Working from home also presented several benefits for myself and my coworkers. For example, I was able to work from wherever I wanted assuming I had my laptop and access to internet. This allowed me to spend time all over this summer: I worked from home, from my girlfriend’s house, and even from my cousin’s house in Ottawa. I took advantage of my freedom this summer wherever I could. Another benefit to working from home was cost- I could live at my parent’s house, and had to pay nothing for transportation, or rent to be near  the office.  I believe the benefits of working-from-home outweighed the difficulties and costs for me, and I believe I was happier this summer without having to travel to the office every day.
          </br></br>I appreciated working for MANTECH during the Summer, and I am still working part time for them. I had a great time and did make friends among my coworkers.

      <h2>ERIS</h2>
      <h5>January 6th, 2020</h5>
      <p>
                    My first co-op term of University started in May of 2019 after my second year of study. I had 8 months of co-op, which I could either split into two separate four month co-op terms or have a single eight month co-op term. While applying for jobs for the Summer and Fall of 2019, both in and outside of the Guelph co-op portal, I made it clear that I was available for eight months to give me any sort of edge on the competition of desperate summer interns.
          </br></br>I had a few interviews while applying, but no offers, until I applied for a position as a Data Technician at ERIS (Environmental Risk Information Services). I went to their Toronto office for an interview, where I was quizzed on Python, SQL, and basic communications questions, followed by a sit-down with a data engineer and the Director of Research and Data at ERIS. The director’s name was Melanie Veltman, she would eventually become my direct supervisor. I was informed that my job would mostly include working with Python and SQL to solve mzy colleagues’ problems and helping them with their work. I was offered the job a few days later on April 25th, with a starting day of May 6th, leaving me only eleven days to move to Toronto to start working. I found an apartment in those following days and moved in. I chose to work for ERIS because I wanted an experience working in an office environment, working on real software to give me experience towards what I will inevitably do when I graduate. I am in co-op for that same reason, and this work term only confirmed that 
          </br></br>ERIS’s main service is providing environmental risk information for developers within a set of national standards. Locations of chemical spills within a certain area of a planned development for example. The data team, of which I was a part, operates using an Oracle PL/SQL database to store environmental risk data across North America. The office that I worked in was located on 38 Lesmill Road in Toronto. There were fifteen people working with me on the data team, they worked all day with SQL procedures to ETL (Extract, Transfer, and Load) data from Government agencies into ERIS’s database.
          </br></br>I had several goals throughout my work term, which changed as my role changed within the company. At first, I had a main goal of two things: understanding the database structure employed at ERIS and learning SQL to a point where I could easily interact with their database. My goals expanded to include learning the proprietary software used by ERIS for the data team workflow. While I worked at ERIS, I asked for as much development work as possible, to work with the team who manufactured the proprietary software using Java and Python. I wanted to work with this team to have the experience of working on industry grade software during a co-op term.
          </br></br>I was given a number of projects to work on that allowed me to flex my programming skills, such as: scraping the locations of every well in New Jersey, migrating our production database to a new version of Oracle, and consulting on machine-learning Optical Character Recognition. During my work on these projects, I learned many skills: my Python skills increased considerably, my teamwork skills within a software team improved as I had to adapt to different ideas and requirements from the team. I worked on these goals by researching different Python packages I had to use and using online resources in general to help me understand and work in Python because I had never worked in Python before. I also was helped by my team to understand the codebase I would be interacting with.
          </br></br>I accomplished all the goals I set for myself this term and completed all projects I was assigned. The most interesting project I had was singlehandedly creating a piece of software that would load Access files into our database. This task seems somewhat simple at first but when concerned with absolute data consistency, migrating between databases becomes challenging. I used Python to complete this task, learning on the job and through exterior projects.
          </br></br>This job will be beneficial to both my academic and employment careers; I learned about working in and as a team, I learned new skills and techniques that will benefit me, and I learned what it was like to work in an office environment.
          </br></br>My favourite aspect of working at ERIS was the social environment of the office. I made several friends at work, we went out to lunch together every day, would chat in the office about work and non work-related topics, I played video games and badminton after work. I genuinely enjoyed working with them every day and I am somewhat saddened that I won’t see them very commonly anymore. My co-op experience included moving to live by myself in a new city, starting a job as the only co-op student, and having my first real full-time employment were made much easier by the welcoming and friendly nature of those that I worked with.
          </br></br>Overall, I had a great experience working at ERIS. I learned lots of new things, made new friends, and got to for the first-time work on industry software. I am thankful to my colleagues, who made my transition and life while in Toronto. I particularly want to thank my manager Melanie Veltman, who always helped me if I needed it and made sure my transition was seamless.
