      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <h5>January 6th, 2020</h5>
      <p>My name is Patrick Copp. I am currently in my third year of study at the University of Guelph in the Computer Science Program. I am currently pursuing a minor degree in Business Economics. This blog is for the storage and display of my co-op work term reports throughout my years of study.</p>

      <h2>ERIS</h2>
      <h5>January 6th, 2020</h5>
      <p>
                    My first co-op term of University started in May of 2019 after my second year of study. I had 8 months of co-op, which I could either split into two separate four month co-op terms or have a single eight month co-op term. While applying for jobs for the Summer and Fall of 2019, both in and outside of the Guelph co-op portal, I made it clear that I was available for eight months to give me any sort of edge on the competition of desperate summer interns.
          </br></br>I had a few interviews while applying, but no offers, until I applied for a position as a Data Technician at ERIS (Environmental Risk Information Services). I went to their Toronto office for an interview, where I was quizzed on Python, SQL, and basic communications questions, followed by a sit-down with a data engineer and the Director of Research and Data at ERIS. The director’s name was Melanie Veltman, she would eventually become my direct supervisor. I was informed that my job would mostly include working with Python and SQL to solve mzy colleagues’ problems and helping them with their work. I was offered the job a few days later on April 25th, with a starting day of May 6th, leaving me only eleven days to move to Toronto to start working. I found an apartment in those following days and moved in. I chose to work for ERIS because I wanted an experience working in an office environment, working on real software to give me experience towards what I will inevitably do when I graduate. I am in co-op for that same reason, and this work term only confirmed that 
          </br></br>ERIS’s main service is providing environmental risk information for developers within a set of national standards. Locations of chemical spills within a certain area of a planned development for example. The data team, of which I was a part, operates using an Oracle PL/SQL database to store environmental risk data across North America. The office that I worked in was located on 38 Lesmill Road in Toronto. There were fifteen people working with me on the data team, they worked all day with SQL procedures to ETL (Extract, Transfer, and Load) data from Government agencies into ERIS’s database.
          </br></br>I had several goals throughout my work term, which changed as my role changed within the company. At first, I had a main goal of two things: understanding the database structure employed at ERIS and learning SQL to a point where I could easily interact with their database. My goals expanded to include learning the proprietary software used by ERIS for the data team workflow. While I worked at ERIS, I asked for as much development work as possible, to work with the team who manufactured the proprietary software using Java and Python. I wanted to work with this team to have the experience of working on industry grade software during a co-op term.
          </br></br>I was given a number of projects to work on that allowed me to flex my programming skills, such as: scraping the locations of every well in New Jersey, migrating our production database to a new version of Oracle, and consulting on machine-learning Optical Character Recognition. During my work on these projects, I learned many skills: my Python skills increased considerably, my teamwork skills within a software team improved as I had to adapt to different ideas and requirements from the team. I worked on these goals by researching different Python packages I had to use and using online resources in general to help me understand and work in Python because I had never worked in Python before. I also was helped by my team to understand the codebase I would be interacting with.
          </br></br>I accomplished all the goals I set for myself this term and completed all projects I was assigned. The most interesting project I had was singlehandedly creating a piece of software that would load Access files into our database. This task seems somewhat simple at first but when concerned with absolute data consistency, migrating between databases becomes challenging. I used Python to complete this task, learning on the job and through exterior projects.
          </br></br>This job will be beneficial to both my academic and employment careers; I learned about working in and as a team, I learned new skills and techniques that will benefit me, and I learned what it was like to work in an office environment.
          </br></br>My favourite aspect of working at ERIS was the social environment of the office. I made several friends at work, we went out to lunch together every day, would chat in the office about work and non work-related topics, I played video games and badminton after work. I genuinely enjoyed working with them every day and I am somewhat saddened that I won’t see them very commonly anymore. My co-op experience included moving to live by myself in a new city, starting a job as the only co-op student, and having my first real full-time employment were made much easier by the welcoming and friendly nature of those that I worked with.
          </br></br>Overall, I had a great experience working at ERIS. I learned lots of new things, made new friends, and got to for the first-time work on industry software. I am thankful to my colleagues, who made my transition and life while in Toronto. I particularly want to thank my manager Melanie Veltman, who always helped me if I needed it and made sure my transition was seamless.
